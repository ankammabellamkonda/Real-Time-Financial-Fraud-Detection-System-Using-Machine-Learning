# Real-Time-Financial-Fraud-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning
🚀 Real-Time Financial Fraud Detection System Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Real-Time Financial Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning to identify suspicious financial transactions with high accuracy. The system analyzes transaction patterns and predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate using a trained ML pipeline.

A user-friendly Streamlit web application enables real-time prediction by allowing users to input transaction details and instantly receive fraud risk results.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, pipeline creation, and deployment.
